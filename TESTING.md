# CardVault Multi-Tenant Testing & QA Notes

## Testing Questions
- [ ] How should Global Admins handle organization deactivation/suspension?
- [ ] Should Organization Admins be able to see user activity logs?
- [ ] What happens when an organization reaches its user limit?
- [ ] Should there be audit trails for user role changes?
- [ ] How should card ownership transfer when users are removed from organizations?

## Issues Found

### High Priority
- [ ] Org Admins should  have the System Menu
- [ ] All cards in an Organization are owned by the Organization.  Removing a user simply removes thier access to CardVault and removes them from the Organization.
- [ ] Deactivation/suspension of an organization should envoke the backup of the organizations cards and remove those entries from the database.
- [ ] Global Admins should have a dashboard showing current database size and system size with warnings on disk space available.
- [ ] When an organization reaches its user limit, they should not be able to add more users without removing a user.
- [ ] There should be an audit trail for user role changes.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Does the Backup Database and Backup Images only backup items from that Organization, it should
- [ ] Under System Management, Full System Backup should only be available for Global_Admins
- [ ] User Management, there should only be 2 types of users, User and Admin.
- [ ] Organization Admins should see user activity.
- [x] **Users should have the ability to change their own password when logged into the application.** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [ ] There should be a forgot password item on the login page with verification based on email associated with the user account in the system.

### Low Priority / Nice to Have
- [ ] Possible Branding for login page per organization.  Maybe a logo and color scheme changes.  CardVault should still be visible somewhere on the login page.
