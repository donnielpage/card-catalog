- Have dedicated ops team
- Data sovereignty requirements

### When to Choose On-Premises:
✅ **Best for:**
- Predictable workloads
- Have ops expertise
- Regulatory requirements
- Long-term cost optimization
- Complete control needed

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Rapid growth expected
- Limited capital budget
- No dedicated ops team
- Global distribution needed

### When to Choose Hybrid:
✅ **Best for:**
- Cost optimization priority
- Specific compliance needs
- Mix of workload types
- Gradual migration strategy
